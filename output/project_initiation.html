ContentsThis publication contains the following topics:TopicSee PageBackground3Project definition4Project Organisation Structure6Project Approach6Project Tolerances6Project Controls6Initial Project Plan7Project Quality Plan9Appendix A: Product Descriptions11Appendix B: Project Roles292. BackgroundMEEDAN will build a web-based cross-language social networking platform and to provide associated services for QFI as further described in this Agreement and the PROPOSAL. The objective outcome is a cross-language (Arabic and English, with a design to accommodate other language) internet-based social learning platform and resource that will initially be deployed to facilitate ongoing learning and social connections between students and/or teachers from QFI’s cultural exchange program and teachers, students and other participants in QFI programs as determined by QFI, including without limitation all Software and Documentation related thereto (the “Social Learning Platform”). MEEDAN will provide the initial hosting of the platform as further set forth in this Agreement. It is intended that the resource developed and provided in accordance with this Agreement will become a solution that may be used and deployed by a range of third parties working to create online educational collaborations between teachers, students, classrooms, and schools.  3.    Project Definition3.1.  Project ObjectivesThe QFI platform project seeks to:<em> Generate a solid research deliverable based on user interviews that grounds the needs, use habits, technical skills, and o against project objectives. * Work with the QFI network of educational tech researchers and the QFI Tech advisory board to leverage and/or incorporate * Develop and deploy a networking solution for the QFI language learning classrooms</em> Develop and deploy a lightweight language learning/chat application for the language learning students (if our research supports this as viable)<em> Work with QFI to define phase 2 objectives and development approach to the larger Social Knowledge Network</em> Work in an open source software environment<em> Leverage Open Educational Resource (OER) 3.2.   Project ScopeThe software will be developed and hosted by Meedan, the program (the use of the technology and its relationship to existing programs) will be implemented by QFI.  As envisioned, the QFI Social Language Learning Platform will facilitate a range of digital collaborations between students and educators. While core technologies will benefit from our past and concurrent development efforts, we will approach the QFI development process with a view to the challenges and opportunities in engaging a young audience. We are particularly keen to model language learning games into the platform, creating incentive for learning by tapping into the sorts of digital interaction forms that younger users find most familiar and compelling.This project will seek to deliver a fully functional and documented platform to QFI at the close of an initial 12 months engagement. This cross-language social networking platform that will enable a diverse set of Arabic and English language learners from the QFI classroom exchange program to create content and exchange messages, develop and maintain relationships, and engage in ongoing learning beyond the scope of their classrooms. While the ultimate specification and solution will be user/client driven, we offer the following as indicative of a potential feature set:1. Profile Creation and Management2. Profile Image upload and management3. Profile Video upload and management4. Social Subscription services (friending)  5. Status update and management (micro-blog)6. Content update and management (blog)7. Content rating tools (favorites)8. Translation services for status and content updates9. Translated asynchronous messaging (message)10. Translated synchronous messaging (chat)11.  Human translation correction and revision of all user generated content12.  URL (web content) automated translation – (for users to share translated links from either English language or Arabic language web- with Meedan Transbrowser)13.  Integration with Facebook, Twitter, Wat-Wet (Arabic Twitter client), Maktoob, and other social networking site14.  Rich media translation tools for video transcription and translationIn addition to the features described above Meedan’s team would like to explore game-like interactions within the context of this engagement. Such ‘modules’ could include:1. ‘My Vocabulary’ tool - to allow students to create and share lists of words and phrases for language learning and to share these lists and translations with friends2. Language Learning games – creative tools to engage language learners3.3.   Project DeliverablesThe principal specialist products (Appendix A) will be:T1.  User Testing PlanT2.

ExclusionsThis project will exclude any hardware equipment, and is limited in its scope to the first phase of the platform design, development and implementation.3.5.  ConstraintsQFI will be responsible for addressing how stated project goals might be either pushed back or replaced in the context of outside opportunities related to other project partners, technologies, platforms. All project partners are aware that this work is very innovative and that the global education ecosystem is in a nascent state. Understanding this as a project constraint and adjusting deliverables and expectations will be a critical part of long term project success. 3.6.    Assumptions</em> QFI will manage and facilitate interactions with partners and end users as needed for development of specifications and ongoing development, such as facilitating introductions and access needed to preform user interviews, partner surveys, and other user testing and user research products. * QFI and their project partners will assume the responsibilities for all aspects of community engagement and management, including selecting, moderating and curating content on the platform.4.    Project Organisation StructureThe project management structure for the QFI Platform project is identified below. Notes on the project organisation and role descriptions are included in Appendix B.RolePositionOrganisationProject BoardProject Executive/Senior UserProject ManagerQFISenior SupplierCEOMeedanOther RolesProject Design LeadUI/UX LeadMeedan5.    Project ApproachWe enter this work with a conviction that our success is dependent on the capacity of the developed online platform to facilitate cross-language discussions and interactions in a way that accommodates current use patterns, bandwidth constraints, and identified needs of the platform’s end users.Meedan’s approach to this development will, therefore, be grounded in solid project research. We propose a development cycle with significant investment in research (user/partner interviews), persona development (archetypal system users), use case development, and, a final specification (wireframes, detailed information architecture, technical solution). In the development phase of the project we will leverage and contribute to the open source community; this is the most appropriate development approach for social software and provides Meedan’s clients with a platform that can be maintained and extended by a global community of developers. Additionally, the platform will be packaged as a virtual machine image to minimise technical requirements for its deployment and support.In terms of leveraging our own past resources, Meedan will capitalise on assets developed through our four-year technology partnerships with IBM research. These assets will form a foundation that includes machine translation processing (Machine Translation) services between Arabic and English,  and Hybrid (Human plus Machine) Translation workflow tools.  6. Project TolerancesThe tolerance level of the project implementation schedule is +/- 1 month.7.  Project ControlsThe Project Control will ensure that, for each level within the Project Management Team, the next level of management can:<em> Monitor progress</em> Compare achievement with the Project Plan<em> Detect problems</em> Initiate corrective action<em> Authorise further work.The main controls of this project are:</em> Project Initiation Document: The Project Initiation Document (PID) is prepared and submitted to the Project Board.<em> Exception Reports: Exception Reports will be generated if the Project Manager forecasts that the tolerances agreed for any Stage, or the Project, will exceed those agreed with the Project Board.</em> End Stage Assessments: End Stage Assessments will be undertaken at the end of each Stage, and will be supported by the key deliverables of each Stage.<em> Highlight Reports: Highlight Reports will be provided by the Project Manager on a monthly basis to the Project Board.</em> Change/Issue Management: All issues raised will be recorded by the Project Manager in the Issue Log. The Project Manager will ensure that appropriate action is taken to resolve issues during the project, and any remaining issues outstanding at Project Closure are catered for in the Follow-On Action Recommendations Report.<em> Project Closure: A final project report will be provided at the end of the project.The Project Board will also monitor the environment outside the project and bring to the notice of those concerned, such as the Project Manager, any changes that affect the project.8.
