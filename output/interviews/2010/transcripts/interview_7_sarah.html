          <p>Update on where the project is at.</p>
          
          <p>How's it going?</p>
          
          <p>How is your coursework going?</p>
          
          <p>Flashcards?
          I see the point -- it has a wiki that we could use.
          but it isn't that different</p>
          
          <p>No one has been using it very much -- most people haven't been using it.</p>
          
          <p>What can I do better?</p>
          
          <p>It has to present something completely different -- it's not like here's another email client or here's another social network.</p>
          
          <p>Here's a thing that is a little like google docs.</p>
          
          <p>I like the dropbox -- I like the wiki.</p>
          
          <p>I'm not sure how we actually decided on Epsilen.</p>
          
          <p>They projected someone's computer on the screen.</p>
          
          <p>We were required to put stuff ... I thought we were required to put stuff on the wiki while we were in DC.</p>
          
          <p>The idea is to share resources -- but I don't think that has happened so far, I'm</p>
          
          <p>It;s an excellent idea ()</p>
          
          <p>We're all very pressed for time -- a lot of people didn't put up content before the school year started.</p>
          
          <p>I think it is just probably.</p>
          
          <p>I enjoyed seeing people's emails saying how they are doing.</p>
          
          <p>If I asked her directly it would (probably happen) --</p>
          
          <p>it's interesting to see people's approach</p>
          
          <p>Me, I'm probably going to finish the alphabet by November -- Audrey does the alphabet in a few days only.</p>
          
          <p>It's been hard figuring out how much I can expect from them considering that they are in all their other classes.</p>
          
          <p>What people end up doing -- how much I ask, whatever funk they are in. There are some students no matter how little you ask them to do they won't do it. So it is kind of subtle to find a middle ground.</p>
          
          <p>***** Some very motivated people and some very unmotivated people.</p>
          
          <p>I think I had a little bit of too high expectation how much the students could do -- I wasn't taking into account how much work they really have.</p>
          
          <p>I would just assume they had done work at home, but regardless it helps everyone when we go over it in class.</p>
          
          <p>So</p>
          
          <p>When I give vocabulary, I want them to use it semi-spontaneously -- not just look it up again later. So trying to figure out how -- how many times do we have to do activities around transportation. I can't wait for everyone to totally internalize them.</p>
          
          <p>****** I asked the students to make flashcards -- the MILLION DOLLAR question is why some students don't make questions. That's frustrating to the point that i think I am not going to do it any more - maybe they think it is busy work.</p>
          
          <p>Some who make it study them.</p>
          
          <p>It's frustrating</p>
          
          <p>Are some going to not pass?</p>
          
          <p>Oh yeah. I have one who has decided to fail. He had a test and didn't write anything on it.</p>
          
          <p>but I have people who are failing now but I hope they will not be at the end ... a few people, probably 2 or 3 will not pass.</p>
          
          <p>Age range?</p>
          
          <p>I have three sections. 13 in each section. Lower than I expected.</p>
          
          <p>Coughing and sounds skick</p>
          
          <p>Several dropped out -- maybe becuause they never wanted to take arabic.</p>
          
          <p>I definitely don't have any answers -- I am so mystified honestly. I suspect this is their pattern in a lot of classes. But in arabic when it comes down to it you won't be able to bullshit.</p>
          
          <p>9 As and 4 Fs.</p>
          
          <p>I'm a little</p>
          
          <!-- ========================== -->
          
          
          <!-- = sarah's previous email = -->
          
          
          <!-- ========================== -->
          
          
          <p>Everyone's classes sound awesome.</p>
          
          <p>Here in Portland, there has definitely been a learning curve in terms of figuring out the right pace for my students--I think I was a bit too ambitious in my planning, but I've scaled back a little and it's working.</p>
          
          <p>So far in our unit on daily life, we've covered names, where one is from, places to go each day, ways to get there (bus, taxi, etc), where one lives, and the names of family members. I've been introducing vocab through songs or through micrologues. I've tried to concentrate on getting them to master the most important vocab associated with each one, without many extraneous words. We have focused on conjugating verbs for I and you only.  Next week I plan to introduce conjugations for he and she. Some have mastered these words more successfully than others, of course. Everyone I talked to before starting the job seemed to think that only the most motivated students would want to take Arabic, but in reality, I have quite a cross section of students, from the unmotivated to the very hard-working.  However I feel so lucky to have funding from QFI and not from the school district, because my classes are so much smaller than those of other language teachers, who have 40+ students in their beginning classes.</p>
          
          <p>One interesting thing has been that in each class I have a TA who is an Arabic-speaking ESL student. Not all are equally helpful and they are not allowed to do normal TA things like grade papers and make photocopies, but I really like having them around when we do speaking activities because it gives the students an immediate chance to interact with a native Arabic speaker. I am going to start having the TAs do more short presentations using vocabulary the class is learning so that the students will have more chances to practice listening to people other than me.</p>
          
          <p>It has also been a balancing act to figure out how much time is appropriate to spend on the alphabet. So far we've covered  أ، ب، ت، ث، ج، ح، خ، د، ذ، ر، ز، س، ش and the short vowels. Next week I plan to jump ahead about cover م، ه، ن، ك، ل، before we go back to the more difficult letters like ض and ص. We have been using the third edition of Alif-Baa to help us learn the alphabet (but not vocabulary), and I've found it very helpful mainly because it comes with a website that students can use to do listening exercises and drills at home; since the website tells me that they've done them, they get credit for it. Students had some difficulty navigating the website at first but have said they find it helpful.</p>
          
          <p>I am very impressed by Audrey's cultural activities and extracurriculars, and I want to bring more to my classroom! I've been trying to integrate a cultural perspective on whatever we're covering into my class, but we haven't had any field trips yet. Some students did get to meet members of a delegation here from Qatar and they loved it. Unfortunately the Portland mayor's office limited the number of students I could bring, but I hope we'll have more similar activities in the future. I also in contact with a local calligraphy artist who I want to come in to teach the students about calligraphy after we finish the alphabet.</p>
