          <p>[standard intro]</p>
          
          <h2>How's it going? Do you feel like you understand what is going on with the project?</h2>
          
          <p>I haven't talked to anybody about the project. The DC trip was a workshop to learn bout national foreign language standards, and how we can apply them to our work.</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>context: standards</li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <p>But I am still not a fan of the standards. [I think there is] excess discussion of the standards. A lot of the concrete suggestions really make sense for advanced language students. They make the assumption that they started in kindergarten. They are a little out of touch. It is a big controversy when you should teach dialect. The standards ignored it.</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>controversy: dialect</li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <p>I was <em>irritated by the whole emphasis on technology.</em> I was evaluated for not using enough technology -- but they didn't criticize us. They are not using writing for communication.</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>teacher:frustration=technology</li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <h2>Any other experience come to mind with educational technology?</h2>
          
          <p>I taught lessons over skype, which was a really big challenge to prepare -- more than any other.</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>technology:use=low</li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <p>In my other classes i ... [sometimes use] projectors to show youtube clips or songs.  At my classroom at the high school, I haven't started yet .... but I have started a class at a liberal arts school here in Portland .... [I like to] prepare a google doc and put it on the screen so everyone can see it at once,</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>location: portland</li>
          <li>software: youtube</li>
          <li>technique: video</li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <p>It could be anything, it could be a reading exercise, and then I will have students read</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>technique: reading</li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <p>They can just do what is relevant on their own piece of paper. or if I want to present some vocabulary .... But I still want to present it verbally first. They start depending on the paper to tell them what to say. [She sees that they learn better if they can't write it down at first -- present verbally and have students work together talking.]</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>student:participation=low</li>
          <li>technique:groups</li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <p>I can just open it and project it on the screen, and then I am not writing on the board, then I can be paying attention to the class.
          This isn't so much of an issue in college, when you are writing stuff on the board your back it to the [younger] class, you don't know what people are doing, are they texting?</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>student: age</li>
          <li>student: misbehavior</li>
          <li>context: classroom</li>
          <li>physically: facing students</li>
          <li>software: google docs</li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <p>I like to open up a document and have them see it rather than write it on the board. I can't write the warmup up. [at the beginning of class, because I am busy].</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>context: time</li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <p>I did see also once a very impressive presentation by a teacher at a conference, a Chinese teacher, she succeeded in only speaking Chinese (which is really hard to do) and then making her entire lesson in powerpoint and then every direction that she might need to give, so she could speak only chinese. That would take a really long time.</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>time: preparation</li>
          <li>software: powerpoint</li>
          <li>teacher: focus</li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <p>[Based on Sarah's comments, it is clear how the teachers have very specific needs in the moment of the class. They want to be at the front of the class and really own it, with maximum focus. The teacher needs to literally be able to be constantly looking each student in the eye as she speaks in front of the room. There are many technologies which push the teacher away from that role of leader, with potentially catastropic results (ie, the teacher looks bad in front of the students.) - CGB]</p>
          
          <h2>What textbook are you using?</h2>
          
          <p>Something i have really really loved to be able to make myself .... the book that i have assigned to my high school and college classes comes with a DVD which works really badly, it comes with a website, a saving grace. [Alef B... sp?] For stuff that only has a right or wrong answer, it will grade it for you, which has a lot of time. To some extent it will tell you if students have done the exercise. It's a very common textbook. Most college teachers use it to teach the alphabet.</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>mode: web</li>
          <li>TODO: get Alef [sp?]</li>
          <li>context: other teachers behaviour</li>
          <li>context: textbook popularity</li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <p>The third edition is the first one to have a website with it. I like the website.</p>
          
          <h2>How does [the textbook website] teach? Why do you like it?</h2>
          
          <p>The way it teaches is similar to the book -- i like the fact that it has an audio element. I don't usually introduce new letters in class. I let the book introduce them. I like that we don't have to spend a lot of time in class. It shows someone pronouncing the letters. ... It is basically the textbook, or all the audio visual expanded and put on line.  If you get something wrong it will say something in Arabic, and if you say something right. <em>It gives immediate feedback if you are getting something right or wrong.</em> When you correct someone's homework it doesn't give you that.</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>time: classroom</li>
          <li>technique: show the actual pronunciation</li>
          <li>technique: immediate feedback</li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <h2>What's the worst thing you see in your work? What bugs you?</h2>
          
          <p>I hate that they use a lot of transliteration. This is a difficult thing about teaching Arabic: you can start on vocabulary and the students will transliterate a lot. There is really no good solution to that, the more the students get used to translation, the more they let it go once they learn the Arabic -- but usually they find it hard to stop.</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>controversial: transliteration</li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <p>[who is "they"? CGB]</p>
          
          <h2>What kind of thing would you like to be able to do, if you could do anything?</h2>
          
          <p>I would like it if there was a way for them to do some written drills on the website. It is important for them to actually practice Arabic. ... Typing in Arabic: they can choose the letter and form the word that way. [For example:] A computer system where they have to complete drill #3 and they don't get to move on -- it's not how many things you got right, it's that you have gotten it right and then you move on.</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>technique:game=typing</li>
          <li>mode: web</li>
          <li>software: yamli</li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <p>Most students don't learn to self-correct very quickly, knowing that you have done something wrong and then learning how to do it right is important with a language. If the person doesn't understand, they need to correct quickly. Also many students don't see a distinction between learning the material and doing their homework. They think that if they have done their homework they have done everything. But you an do all the homework and still not be prepared.</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>student: attitude</li>
          <li>studying: technique</li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <p>[I want] something that would make it hard to escape the homework.</p>
          
          <p><em>I really like students to make flash cards. But I can't make studying flashcards part of their requirement. If they could use the website to make flashcards -- if people could put a picture, rather than an English word.</em></p>
          
          <h2>What types of learning styles do you see in your class?</h2>
          
          <p>I think for college students for some extent they have learned a style that is based on words. Especially when they go to a more competitive school, it's because they have adapted to this style which is rewarded which is not very visual. A lot of students are unhappy when you try to make them learn auditorily. Also a lot of students don't like drawing. Especially in high school, I want them to associate the word with the image. Even though it is a far off goal, i would like them to move away from directly translating in their minds, having a translation mindset in Arabic will slow you down.</p>

          <li>student: learning style</li>
