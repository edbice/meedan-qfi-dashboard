          <h2>What kind of computers do you have at your school?</h2>
          
          <p>We did have a smart board. I come from a school that is more technology -- we had a lot more different devices. I don't know too much about the new school, Washington Latin Public. [I was] previously at Provo Utah public school -- had access to lots of technology, more of my limitations were how to use technology, how to make it work.</p>
          
          <h2>What techniques for learning do you use?</h2>
          
          <p>I would try something and be really excited and then it would flop. We've tried cellphone games where we text ... we've tried webcam conversations with kids in the middle east. Web cams are really hard because of the time difference.</p>
          
          <p>We videotaped ourselves and put it on the blog, and they videotaped themselves. I thought it was gonna be a really cool idea, and i still think it is.
          We've had flip phones and those are great because they are really easy to use for the students.
          We had an iPod touch, but I couldn't for the life of me figure out [why].
          We had computers in our classroom with internet.
          We had a computer generated software learning thing for arabic learning. That was really great. It's called Arabic Without Walls. It's generated by UC Berkely and BU.</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>video</li>
          <li>phones</li>
          <li>ipod</li>
          <li>classroom</li>
          <li>software</li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <h2>What is Arabic Without Walls?</h2>
          
          <p>It has drills flashcards -- it's on the internet. There is dialogue that you click into and write responses, teacher can go in and see [how the students are working.] [It has a focus on] grammar, culture. If there is anything i would want, that is it. THe other stuff that you can get from rosetta stone and things like that, those are companies that are doing all languages, and Arabic is one of the, AWW is done by really great arabic professors, the best of the best.  It's really new so a lot of people haven't started using it. I have 8 computers -- so I couldn't have them all on it at one time. I do know programs that do have students in front of the computer. You can learn arabic without even a teacher who knows arabic -- with a satellite teacher. There are some that will do it without a teacher, if you don't want credit. I would split the class up into two or three groups, one would be doing an activity, one on the computer, and they would go through all of the vocabulary or something, and they have to get a 100%. It was SO GREAT.</p>
          
          <p>It's great for teachers who are teaching arabic, because you can have small groups and talk to them about things one on one that they need. They can listen to a dialogue -- and then you can say OK [you have to keep working while I do this with other students].</p>

          <li>software</li>
          <li>grammar</li>
          <li>culture</li>
          <li>vocabulary</li>
          <li>satellite_teacher</li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <p>[It's helpful because she is busy.]</p>
          
          <p>Some kids had three or four years of arabic and some had none -- that's common because arabic is such a small language. So that was important for them to be able to work on their level. They really liked it. Based on the interactive classes.</p>
          
          <p>[What do students like to do? We need to talk to more students.]</p>

          <li>students</li>
          <li>levels</li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <h2>What about the SMS game? Why didn't it work?</h2>
          
          <p>Students texted their answers. That day was hard for me. We had a texting game -- I thought it was gonna be great, they were in two different groups, they had to sign everything, and then text their answers to the other students -- the first problem we found out was that not everyone had cell phones.   They had to go to their lockers and even when they did not many had them in their lockers.
          - most studne't parents didn't want them texting -- they had no SMS capabilities.
          - some of the students cellphones were a lot slower than others. So the game didn't work.</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>sms</li>
          <li>fail</li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <p>I'm not saying theres not a way, but after doing that the boundaries would be a lot different than what I initially thought. I think what would be really fun, you could there was a trivia on the board, and you could punch in your answer from your seat. And it would immediately propagate all the answers. And that would be really cool -- I was trying to use texts to show data on what students.</p>
          
          <h2>What would you do with that data?</h2>
          
          <p>["SMART STICKS" Something he passed out to everyone and they just had like ABCD -- for voting on quiz answers in real time]</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>smartstick</li>
          <li>voting</li>
          <li>realtime</li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <p>He could go after the quiz so he could show what percentage of answers (were given), who answers A B or C. I'm sure it was interesting, but it was also the students themselves who could say, "oh i picked d" but it was wrong. So you could see why people picked the wrong ones and help them understand why they chose that one. And to me that was the best technique. Students help each other learn languages -- The whole class is pairs and groups, all day. I talk only for 5 minutes and then turn it over to them. Back and forth and back and forth.</p>

          <ul>
          <li>written</li>
          <li>spoken</li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <p>Listening and reading -- if you can write and speak, you are going to pick it. My philosophy is -- a lot of people dont agree with this -- you can read it and write it so many times that what you have, you have it.</p>
          
          <p>[anti-test driven lesson]</p>
          
          <p>They have introduced themselves 100,000 times in class.  So when someone asks them if they speak arabic -- and she was feeling really stupid. But they guy was blow away, "wow you really learned it." People say "I can just speak this and this "</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>repetition</li>
          <li>confidence</li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <h2>How do you teach confidence?</h2>
          
          <p>Actually i think technology is really beneficial in this -- I'm addicted to learning languages and I have been humilated so many times, there are things that I will not do. Then there are other things that the teachers do that get me to talk and talk. So one of the things I do is have the students get up and speak for a certain amount of time, depending on how long it is. They can say anything they want, and make as many mistakes as they want -- the only requirement is that they soeak the whole time. Or I add on time.</p>
          
          <p>They can't fail. Before we start, I tell them: You can't fail. At the end I don't correct them at all, or I ask them if they would like them to correct their mistakes. The idea that someone is going to take apart everything you do wrong. I won't even pick out every mistake. Just a theme that will help them next time. I will start by telling them all the things they did right. That by far is one of the best techniques.</p>
          
          <p>They will speak and they feel really confident in speaking after that. An Iraqi principal came to visit and they were saying, I want to show you, I can speak for two minutes, and the Iraqi principal was floored. The point is making it so nonthreatening -- and on a test I will check for 20 correct principles, for full points. If you write a short essay, you are in danger of getting it wrong -- but if you write a long essay, you can't fail. So these kids will write pages of Arabic. You're not taking any points off for essays.  I've had 120 word essays, in the first course of the first year. Most kids, if you just take out the failyre of the language, the succeed, they know they can't fail. I think the technology is fun. They are self correcting themselves, adn they don't have other people watching them do it, so that helps them learn more.</p>
          
          <p>We did blogs where we had students video taping themselvs, that helped -- they were actually forced to say something that made sense. In a video they know is going to middle eastern kids, therefore they ... They [were nevours]-- that ewas pretty hard for them -- I would just not grade them on their mistakes, not even make it an assignment, we're doing it for fun. Participation points I guess. I was really nervous, I'm not very good with the camera. The palestinian kids also were really scared to get on camera -- and they were just speaking arabic -- teenagers are just naturally scared to get on camera. They actually flew us out.

          <h2>Closing thoughts?</h2>
          
          <p>What about a computer program that was specifically writing, and it was designed to only look for correct things, so a student would have to write 100 things correctly -- so they have to keep writing and writing and writing. I think it would hard to do something spoken ... At Georgetown I was interpreting, and they did blogs where the students had to compiple blogs in arabic. Maybe a platform that would work really well with Arabic. (Also useful for digital literacy.) You could force them to video something, they have to speak on it. (You could get all four skills through a social media project. )</p>
