          <ul>
          <li>TODO: get a curriculum</li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <p>I am completely confused about exactly what we are doing. I know that you all are designing some type of platform ...</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>teacher: confused!</li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <h2>How do you teach?</h2>
          
          <p>I think of it as linking the language and content. It is disturbing to me that QFI started a science project without talking to us. If real language learning is going to take place, you have to be .... investigating the cracks, places where there could be connections .. but their aren't. ... Good language learning means when you are able to connect language and content.  ... You could be studying content but also studying language at the same time. Science, physics, archaeology. Normally we teach language as a language arts exercise, and anything else is an add on. ... If there is any value in technology, it is brining those threads together.</p>
          
          <h2>How much do you use technology?</h2>
          
          <p>I am technologically illiterate.</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>teacher:skill=nontechnical</li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <p>Some of the things [people have been showing] -- I have not seen tech like that -- we do it manually. I have not seen -- and this is where I see you all -- it seems to me that there is some stuff going on, maybe not with language but with some other fields. <em>I get the feeling that we are trying to connect some things.</em> Language of special purposes, the language of science, the language of business .... That kind of thing -- they do bring things together. My experience with technology has been pretty low. I belong to a generation that grew up without a lot of it -- my orientation is not technical at all. That doesn't mean that I am against it, but I don't use it myself.</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>context: cross-disciplinary</li>
          <li>language: style=business|science|specialized</li>
          <li>TODO: experience with elearning? CGB</li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <p>There are two areas that seem to be done -- this add-one stuff. The kids go to sites, they collect cultural information, they collect corpora, they put together pieces of stuff, for some kind of project, or more language learning, that .... also includes connection with kids, for example, the Qatari kids and kids here would have some way that they could have conversations -- sometimes it is only done in one language. Usually the kids here speak Arabic and there speak English -- they swap.</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>location: Qatar</li>
          <li>technique: collecting cultural information</li>
          <li>technique: distance conversations</li>
          <li>technique: swap languages</li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <p>They post them and the teacher grades them. Those are the two main ways that I have seen language learning. And then of course there is the talking heads stuff -- showing the movie, all of the standard stuff. It should be be part of the curriculum. In the old days it used to be reel to reel movies. You're too young to remember those.</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>technique: movie</li>
          <li>technique: talking heads stuff</li>
          <li>technique: standard stuff</li>
          <li>context: history and the "Way it Was Done"</li>
          <li>technique: reel to reel</li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <p>A teacher picks things, a discreet item, and shows them. The advantage of technology is that it gives you versatility. But I don't know how one gets creative.</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>teacher: attitude="technology gives versatility"</li>
          <li>creativity</li>
          <li>TODO: folloup on examples of creativity in classroom</li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <h2>Have you ever seen it fail?</h2>
          
          <p>Usually that has to do with the unimaginative part of teachers. The teacher didn't have a clear idea of how to use the tool, they weren't very creative. One of the things that we have been honing away with the teacher -- you really need to know what the assessment is going to look like.</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>context: impending assessment</li>
          <li>requirement: preparation</li>
          <li>role: assessor</li>
          <li>teacher: creativity=low</li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <p>What is it that you really want to know? You start at the end and work your way up to the front. You know what you are working towards. When most learning happens, you start in one place and you keep winding your way to the next stop -- a lot of the technological stuff I have seen has been like that. THe more intelligent ones let you bump up to the next one and then if you need to you can go back. But good teaching includes the idea that you know where you want this student to end up. Technology, or flying them to Doha, is all part of that same package. <em>It seems to me that if there is a way whereby teachers can be given the tool with which they can design the work...</em>  So ... the teacher has more investment in their curriculum with the tool.</p>
          
          <h2>What are the different models of language education, from your perspective</h2>
          
          <p>After School model -- irregular.
          IB model -- more intensive, students must meet rigorous standards.
          Boston model -- a regular foreign language classroom designed by the teacher herself, and in effect has a component of student who is a particular kind of student. So you have a particular cohort of students who are different. They are not the normal high school kid.
          Intensive After School -- meets 4 times a week (Adly in Hawaii)</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>education:model= afterschool| IB | Boston | Intensive after school</li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <p>The four models -- how would these teachers. How do they maneuver in a way with stuff that they can put up on a site that would make sense to them and others, how would <em>they create things on those sites without making fools of themselves -- [with] a modicum of privacy</em>, but it is still there so the evaluator can have a conversation, or if they want to share with teachers, they can do that.</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>privacy</li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <p>Looking bad -- [teachers are] from the beginning, because we don't have very many textbooks or resources for Arabic k - 12, one of the things we kept trying to do is to post their lessons on the Arabic K-12 website. They would not. .... They did not want to put themselves in a position to be criticized. <em>They were willing to, with 2 or 3 of the teachers together.</em></p>
          
          <p>[This suggests that teachers working in groups may be the best way for the teachers to develop curriculum and work with tools. -CGB]</p>
          
          <p>How do you do that? The next question becomes -- most of these teachers are really very busy -- I have yet to see anybody who is [doing it] ... How do you do this so this doesn't take hours and hours?  The young woman here at Boston latin, her <em>fulltime</em> job is a sign language instructor. She has these two classes on Friday, which she has to prepare for, and then in addition to that she has to create a curriculum -- she has no textbook -- so all of her things are new. <em>I don't know if you have ever created a curriculum, but it is a pain in the butt and it takes a long time to do.</em></p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>time</li>
          <li>quote</li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <p>So she creates a set of discrete lessons. If you had a really good platform, could she take a look at the end and say gee, what is it I have done here, am I going in the direction I want to go. So she is now working full time, and adding on teaching, so she's going a little ... nutsy.</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>quote</li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <p>I would probably go for the simplest possible platforms that you could possibly come up with. To the point that you think, "do I need to go back to kindergarten?"</p>
          
          <ol>
          <li>Your purpose -- to be be able to get these teachers to use the platform. You need to talk us into getting the teachers to do it. So it is not something that they have to do -- they need to say "I need to use X because it is going to make my life simpler." I would create a way they could <em>actually talk to one another without having this information to be obvious to all the rest of the world.</em></li>
          </ol>
          
          
          <p>[Wait, we already have this, a list, what is missing? Is it just curatorial energy, eg, a facilitator -- are they really waiting for someone to take the reigns and drive a new group dynamic? Or will they need more, in the form of a tool? Or would they prefer some other ways to build a relationship? When will they be getting together next, and what can we do now to make that a better experience for the group? CGB]</p>
          
          <ol>
          <li><p>Privacy -- Whatever these teachers are talking to with other about is not necessarily something QFI will log into on regular basis. So QFI will only see what they allow them to see. They can mess things up and not feel like someone is looking at them -- <em>A very safe space.</em></p></li>
          <li><p>Articulation -- We want to take these different models and take them to the rest of the world -- it is possible to have these models and learn the language at the same time.</p></li>
          </ol>
          
          
          <p>I think that they tools where it becomes an integral part of the classroom -- it is something that is a learned process -- but I think that is not where you're gonna have to start. Even with these savvy kids -- most of the kids are really savvy and they are technologicaly adept, it's not strange to them, <em>they gotta know why they are going to use it and what it is going to do for them.</em></p>
          
          <p>I think if I were doing the afterschool programs, I would want to use it some degree for particular purposes. It would be the idea of the drop box, it would be the kid who has soccer and can't turn it in at class. But if I were the teacher at the IB program, I would put in a set of activities that would allow me to figure out -- a way to communicate with my students on a regular basis, so when I came to class I would know what they are thinking.</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>mode: afterschool</li>
          <li>customization</li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <p>[This suggests that there are a great diversity of applications for the technology -- indicates that we need to keep the tool very activity centric. There may be a dozen implementation scenarios already, which one are we designing for? CGB]</p>
          
          <p>One possible way -- again this is me -- I would assign a daily exercise, and if they can't perform they can let me know why not -- give them a chance to complain, or say, wait a minute, i found a better way to do this, here it is.</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>technique: timing=daily</li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <p>If I assign something and 2/3s of the class can't do it, that tells me that something I taught today didn't make it, and we are going to have to go back. They can silently tell you something.</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>feedback: unwitting</li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <p>Pair work. It doesn't embarass the student. They are not necessarily performing.</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>technique: pairing</li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <p>The biggest way to get students to talk -- this is enormously successful -- is to set them up with projects. Investigating which Pharoh liked to eat figs. Or, looking at how kids speak to their elders in different Arab countries.</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>technique: projects</li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <p>Audrey, she struck me as we were doing teacher training -- she does a lot of competitive stuff, and it sounds to me like the kids love it. She sets it up so that the kids are racing ... All of these teachers, all of them have interesting ways.</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>technique:competition</li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <h1>Other things to mention?</h1>
          
          <p>We have over and over and over again run up against a blank wall -- the teachers get excited and we're going to do this and this! And then it doesn't happen.</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>make sure it is a safe place.</li>
          <li>make sure that the informatino collected can be used to develop the model.</li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <h2>What do you think about Epsilen?</h2>
