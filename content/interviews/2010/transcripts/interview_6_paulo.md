[standard introduction]

## What are you working on? 

I am director of a research and cultural center. There is another teacher who is responsible for arabic language and culture. I just went once to the DC meeting but was not in the original call. In Sao Palo, has offices in other parts of Brazil. I do teach a lot -- i am a professor at the U of SP here. I have been teaching for 15 or more years.  There are several teachers. I also teach anguage but I also teach literature and history at the university. Comparative history ... it depends on the students. 

## How old are your students? What is your class like? 

It depends. I have students from 17 up to 80. In the arabic language and culture program we have students between 13 and 19. 
The idea is to focus on students 13 - 19. 

- classroom: diversity
- student: age
- context: some programs focus only on certain ages
- TODO: matrix of ages 

## At this point we just want to understand what your technology use is like ...

We do have some difficulty in working with technology in the classroom -- for financial reasons.  Also technology is not really common over here, for instance a smart board. it is something we are still planning to have, but so far we don't have it.  We use some films and electronic material, but we would for instance use it, we don't necessarily have the best monitors, sometimes we don't have the best quality of image. 

Even the education material, we would like to develop some special material, especially now that we work with these teenager groups -- technology would be very useful for us to keep them concentrated. We don't have a lot of access to tech -- and I am a professor at one of the most important universities in Brasil. We show them on a TV screen that we bring from the outside, or we get one of the monitors of the computer. We only have one computer that has a large monitor (27") or we just project it on the wall on a screen. 

- technology: monitors and projectors
- cost
- curriculum: custom
- hardware: monitors

But films it's not really a problem, you can see the image quite clearly. WE use it a lot, for instance, we show them an animation of the Arabic letter, where the letter comes and introduces itself, it makes it easier for them to learn to write and read, sometimes with music. We do understand video is something really important for students.

- technique: video
- technique: music 

##What is a normal classroom day like for you?

Usually we have a large group inside a classroom, then we call some students individually. Mostly we have a large group and we call the students over 1 by 1 so we can give them special attention. We always have 1 or 2 assistants -- a teacher and 2 assistants usually. After the class they are ready to talk to the students and to maybe develop some materials for them. The system is quite different than the one in the US -- the curriculum is really different. We are having several new things and [on the radar of the Ministry of Education].

- role:government
- groupwork
- individualattention

Trying to give a certificate at the end of the course. Trying to change the curriculum, so it is possible to offer other languages at the school. Those are the only languages that are taught that are consider part of the curriculum. 

- context: certification

If the program is successful -- this is the very first experience like you have in the US. There is no previous experience with teaching Arabic. 
- teacher: background

This is really something new in Brazil. WE do have also to show them that it is working properly to gather more and more recognition. 

- location:brazil

## What are you expecting with our research?

We already have the possiblity of helping the students to give them those extra activities. I didn't understand if the idea is to implement some devices. Technology is not as fast. here.

[Me: it will only be about 2 more months before we are really up and running with a deployment.]

When we show them like a film, it is attractive for them, it makes some difference when we do offer them something that is a little more advanced. 

- technique: video

## Other ideas for what to use?

Some of them have asked about the possibility of having something more advanced. They are so used to using the internet. At the university it is much easier -- you get students who are more mature and who are more ready to pay attention to what you are say. 

## Do you have internet in the class? 

No. We have email in the staff room -- but if we turn on many computers we will have some difficulties, it will get quite slow. We usually get something and then we have it ready so we have to have many computers. We do have one computer in the classroom -- a notebook. Whenever we want to show something, we bring the monitor into the classroom. We have our own textbook that we have developed, in portugese and arabic. all of the examples are our own -- they make sense for them.

- classroom:computers=1 

*For a regular student, if they want to learn anything other than English and Spanish, he has to learn names of things from other countries. Pierre is going from Stuttgart to Paris, rather than Carlos with Ahmad from Rio to Beirut. Explanations and exercises that make sense for them.* 

[Describes creation of a textbook from the school - it is on order. CGB]

The textbook is really well received. What we really want to do is develop some other materials like DVDs. Some of the solutions seems to be easy for us. We would like to record something, maybe invite people to make a film, but we are still seeing how to organize it. We would like to develop more material than the written material. 

- TODO: get a copy of this textbook.
