[standard introduction]

## What is your background with the QFI project, do you feel like you understand what is going on? 

Well, I haven't talked a whole lot about it ... I haven't really heard [since the first meeting]. 

[Explain a little more, relaxing, friendly tone, establish personable accessible relationship]

## OK, what is your background as a teacher?

My teaching experience is very limited because I am a new teacher. Previously taught in charlstown, MA... 

## What was the technology like in that school?

They used the internet in class mostly to watch videos. Rana (who was in DC, was a teacher in DC with us) setup a voice mailbox. Their homework might be to read a certain passage. You had to chase after the students to remind. She was taeching teh class and Katherine came in at the end of the week. ... I think I would do that again if I had the chance. The school Boston Arts Academy -- the school is working on seeing if they can get computers for the students. In my class we do have computers in class, but as far as the voice mailbox would [be better] because the vast majority of them do have telephones.  If there was some way to get those messages on the computer for me to listen to or for them to re-listen to, or maybe have other students listen to them.

[Perhaps students speak who arabic?]

We had talked about doing that with charlestown -- [international progam] ... it's possible. We were supposed to do video conferencing, but I think it took a really long time to setup -- I don't know if they really want us to do that again, but it seems like voice messages, simple introductory, would maybe work ...

[How does curriculum development work? ]

We the teachers in collaboration with QFI are talking about what we are interested in doing. It is fairly loose, but the original currculum is something that QFI gave us. There is a modified one in the process of typing it up.

- curriculum
- todo

[TODO: get a copy of curriculum. Asked. ]

[Other platforms? Systems that are useful? ]

Having a place to upload multiple videos and audo -- we have a system called EdLIne. We can email all the stydents. Making audio recordings of all of the vocabulary words for our students -- we need a place to upload the recording to the website. 

- software: edline
- software: upload recordings

Sometimes brings cds to class - students. 

## can you tell me more about edline?

This is their first year using edline. Does grading. Setup so we can all have pages for all of the course that we are teaching. When a student or a parent logs in, a student can click on his calendar will have all of his homework.

[TODO: get a login to edline. (via Chris D.)]

## Just a few more questions. what do you use on the web? 

[Used facebook when she was in college.] Don't use twitter and don't plan on it. Has experience with livejournal. [probably was a blogger.]

## How long do you sit at the computer each day

Too long!

## What is your technology like at home? 
[has a computer at house. / has good wifi at home (lives with her parents) / moving later this week]

We do have internet at school but we just started training and haven't really been using computers. Using technology is one of the goals for the school. They do have some sites blocked -- you can't access facebook or youtube from.

- teacher: home tech life
- school: restrictions on websites
- school: has it's own goals

[others at school? What is their technology use like?]

Most of them use computers frequently. The impression is that the school moves very fast -- if you don't check your email you will fall behind. There is a computer lab at the school with new macs. 

## What is the school website?

http://www.edline.net/pages/Boston_Arts_Academy

[Why not use Twitter? Anything in particular about it that you don't like?]

Not so much anything about the design -- I guess I don't feel the need to tweet, to update people on what I am doing most of the time -- it's just sort of a lifestyle. Privacy concern? It's not a dislike, just a lack of interest.

- twitter
- teacher: preferences

## What should we not build? 

I don't really have a problem with forums as long as it is EASY TO READ. 
some websites, the color scheme makes it very hard to read. 
letters are everywhere -- i usually just turn away because it is too much work. 

- readbility: highly desired
- teacher: attitude toward tech

## What is your curriculum development process like? 
we don't have a textbook for our class, we sometimes use a college arabic textbook as a resource. a lot of what we are doing is creating the materials ourselves. 

we do searching on the internet for pictures, videos, clips from TV shows, culutural things that we can use. The grammar stuff is worksheets that we type up ourselves.
