[standard intro]

## What is your background and current position?

I am a junior high school Arabic instructor .... my involvement is junior high.

## What kind of tools do you use in the classroom? 

They find what they need to find to complete the task at home ... I use whatever tools  need. I live outside Boston ... been teaching for 5 years ... some classes meet 3 hours a week, some meet 5 hour ... taught at a cultural center for Arabic americans ... taught adults ... ages are very widespread

## What are your classes like outside of the main school? 

It's kind of like a Sunday school! I meet on Sunday and have them only for 2 hours. one of the many challenges (is time). How do you utilize those 2 hours, so you can go on the following week. How do you motivate them? (sometimes their parents make them come, the parents pay). It's balancing motivation under the pressure of the parents -- they expect a miracle from 8 hours a month.

the interesting thing for our culture -- a lot of the parents speak to their children in english. -- [she asks:] why are you paying money for them to learn Arabic when you don't learn? Why english? How are you motivating the kids at home?

Heritage learners have different needs. Heritage learners their comprehension and oral skills are mugh higher than their ability for accuracy.

You are supposed to get the kids to produce a lot of times orally -- if you work in the FS they categorize you by an oral exam, they don't really care. This is where most of the money goes. All of the activities are usually speaking reading, how do you make it sexy for the kids?

## What strategies do you have? 

You have to give them a lot to prepare at home -- a lot of the kids hit puberty and it's a difficult crowd. 

- study
- age: puberty

[One solution is] recordings and resources that they have to do on their own. It was more a lot of games and a lot of competition with that age group in particular.The dominant textbook in college have a DVD and usually you are following some charaters and a story through them you learn the language. It's very interactive: Iktab. [sp?]

- TODO: get all the Arabic textbooks. 

It's a story that the students follow on their linguistic journey, the grammar and structure are taken from the story. 

It puts very little burden [on the teacher] ... It's a collection of resources. 
The teacher knows that they can trust the book. *So you don't have to take class time to do this, and class time is just practice.*

- classroom: time

I follow the same model to be honest with you. Because I think it is effective, it's a thing we use to explain things in class. 
That is something they can do on their own time. I can't make students *memorize vocabulary.* [In the class it's all] pronunciation.

We don't do a lot of mechanical drills. In high school you often have to, just from my observations about america in general, it is very slow paced, the teacher is not using the target language, and so the students don't produce very much, it's not the environment they are used to. Slowly they see the benefits of studying at home and use it in class, they are using the language from day one, and they are really doing the work. The teacher can already speak the language.

## How else do you see yourself as a teacher? What is your teaching philosophy?

They are responsible -- the way I use technology resources is *to help them be more responsible.* Back in the day you would just give them long vocabulary lists. The teacher would come up with drills to do at home, and he would have to give them the answer key, things to do at home that make the classroom more effective. You have to do your part in class. I did a powerpoint lecture with my voice. Class time could be used for other things. *The best use of class time is to get the students producing the language.*

The most complex task is at the end of class: "put 123 together." .... Listnening, have I prepared them for this listnening -- when we go through it it is incremental, third time we are listening to it, we are taking it to the next level. All of this requires their engagement. I'm not gonna spend time introducing the vocabulary, that could be something that they'd done before. I might ask them to use the vocabulary, or talk about the topic before the listened.What their actual knowledge of that topic is. It's not to go from the beginning to the end. 

Rosetta Stone -- I sat through 2 minutes of it. The problem is that, it doesn't seem like it is a logical order. You learn a name for fish and then you learn a different case. it's strange. ... But something like rosetta stone where the teacher could do something like rosetta stone, some kind of study guide, would be something really helpful, seeing the picture and then making flashcards for the student. But the teacher would have to be able to edit it. I don't really want my kids to learn "fish" and "backpack" .... what is the purpose of that? I would love to be able to choose the words myself. There are things like that where you have online flashcards and quizzes and they give it your score. They did it for our textbooks. ... Lingua-step.

It is a continuation of the DVD to give students more to play around with the language, and for the teacher to see your progress, its a way for the teacher to monitor, and if they don't know the vocab from 4 chapters, they can select those chapters and generate flashcards. I don't use it because *we don't have money for it,* and it is also just based on the textbook. *I would LOVE to have a tool where I could choose the vocab words and the computer would quiz myst students on them.* I'm not sure how detailed it goes. I previewed it. Some students will pay money out of their pocket. Membership is not expensive, she quoted me.  Institutional license $1500 and up.

BA level there is no one. I am not bound by -- like sarah, eventually she has a test, that will be assessing the students and her and her curriculum. 

## What are your goals for teaching?

My goal is to actually have them place out of a semester of Arabic. But it's also to teach them how to use a language. 

It's a way to teach them different types of learners, so the student is not spending time doing these. 

They are not taking the time getting ready to study. 

## How do people learn differently? 

I have a lot of visual learners ... and through hearing -- they always have it on their ipod, through audio or even video -- use of video definitely.  Those are probably the two ... visual learners learn through association -- the image with the word, also through the video
or using colors or symbols to associate. Say, if you do a powerpoint and really draw attention, rather than just giving them a handout. 
Making it easy to interpret from afar -- so you can scan it really easily.
