### Educational Psychology  

In our context we are especially interested in aspects of motivation and issues of "mastery" in the context of language learning. Educational psychology focuses on aspects of the mind which underlie deep factors of success in the classroom and are thus especially relevant for cross-cultural design -- since psychological influences are necessarily more relevant to everyone rather than just a subset of students in a particular environment. Because of our emphasis on educational technolgy, we are particularly interested in understanding aspects related to Human Computer Interaction.
