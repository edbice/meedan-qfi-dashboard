#### Background

Our project began on August 20. Since then we have been talking to teachers and developing our technical path forward. This document is the first formal statement of how we will proceed.

#### The idea: A social learning platform

We are a community of teachers, translators and developers; we are working on a cross-language website for social learning. We want to build a "platform" that is compelling and useful to as many people as possible. Our design criteria include diverse contexts and limitations. We recognize that in order to develop a useful and relevant tool we will need to listen closely to the perspectives of teachers. Qatar Foundation International is committed to creating a system which will facilitate ongoing learning and social connections between students and/or teachers cultural programs. Meedan has been asked to deliver a comprehensive assessment of the technical landscape, and deliver multilingual tools for sharing, learning and teaching. 

#### Our commitment to transparency; or, building Open Source community

It is intended that the resource developed and provided will become a solution that may be used and deployed by a range of teachers, students, classrooms, and schools -- a true platform, not merely a website. To this end we seek to support the work of open source development activity by including transparent documentation, story mapping/release planning, bug tracking, as well as responsive feedback mechanisms.

#### Some concrete steps toward our goal

•	Generate a solid research deliverable based on user interviews that grounds the needs, use habits, technical skills, and o against project objectives. 
•	Work with the QFI network of educational tech researchers and the QFI Tech advisory board to leverage and/or incorporate 
•	Develop and deploy a networking solution for the QFI language learning classrooms
•	Develop and deploy a lightweight language learning/chat application for the language learning students (if our research supports this as viable)
•	Work with QFI to define phase 2 objectives and development approach to the larger Social Knowledge Network
•	Work in an open source software environment
•	Leverage Open Educational Resource (OER) 

As envisioned, the QFI Social Language Learning Platform will facilitate a range of digital collaborations between students and educators. While core technologies will benefit from our past and concurrent development efforts, we will approach the QFI development process with a view to the challenges and opportunities in engaging a young audience. We are particularly keen to model language learning games into the platform, creating incentive for learning by tapping into the sorts of digital interaction forms that younger users find most familiar and compelling.

This project will seek to deliver a fully functional and documented platform to QFI at the close of an initial 12 months engagement. This cross-language social networking platform that will enable a diverse set of Arabic and English language learners from the QFI classroom exchange program to create content and exchange messages, develop and maintain relationships, and engage in ongoing learning beyond the scope of their classrooms. 

#### The role of the formalized featureset

Notably our design includes a feature discussion page for teachers to make their own judgments about each of the features outlined here. That is, in addition to discussing best practices and other parts of the teaching experience, we are invitin teachers directly into our "workshop" to discuss the features in the same place that we are discussing them. 

The format of the forum is a open but strongly moderated forum.

The research leads guide teachers to consideration of each itemized feature in order to make sensible decisions about the direction of the work.

The feedback loop is more than just about making decisions "about the teachers' work" -- we are in fact in a transparent discussion with the teachers, and the developers are working to concretely support an existing community of practice. 

#### The concept of feature tags



#### The features

feature_share
Teachers can share resources. For example: links, documents, essays, extracts, citations, abstracts, taxonomies, curricula, primary sources, blog posts, annotated web pages, video, photos, conversation logs.

feature_translation 
This feature includes all aspects of managing an incoming queue of translation requests: job prioritization, translator reputation, job queuing and locking, content versioning, translation ranking, translation permissioning, translator payments, 

feature_discussion
Teachers can message and comment to each other in translated dialogue about various objects in the system; to gain support for 

feature_enrichment
Teachers and administrators can enrich existing data with semi-automated metadata. 

feature_curriculum
feature_translation

feature_profile 
Profile Creation and Management including avatar uploading, background and summary of interests, links to existing pages about each user of the site; for insight into teacher context.

feature_video 
Support for video uploading and management for engaging students; to simplify showing videos in class and at home.

feature_rating
The teachers are able to rate content as being superior or inferior, probably on a simple scale of 0-3 stars; to help filtering of diverse information to capture what is relevant for busy teachers.

feature_moderation
Human translation correction and revision of all user generated content

feature_wiki
Group ability to create and edit pages while maintaining history of each edit.

#### features under discussion
- Updating a status; for easy broadcasting of classroom activities
- Aggregating content from teachers; for simplified networks of curricula
- Blogging for both individual and group; for group reflection and self-awareness
- Close integration with other social networking sites; for relevance
- Rich media applications with video transcription and translation; for cross-language nuance
- Vocabulary tools for sharing lists of phrases; for engaging study
- Taxonomy development tools; to share content across schools
- Open Educational Resource tagging tools; to simplify curriculum resource planning
- Language Learning games; to engage language learners

As you probably have gathered, we have some ambitious goals -- and we have realized that will will not be able to achieve them without the candid advice of teachers for whom we are designing. 

#### About Meedan

Meedan is dedicated to Arabic and English communication, and by extension we are developing a suite of tools that permit simple, transparent and high-quality translation (Open Source, for any languages, but we are focused on Arabic an English). We have spent several years working on this community model and on the technical backend, which was built in partnership with IBM researchers. Our example news application at http://meedan.net shows the capacities of some of these APIs. Put simply, Meedan is one of the web's first bilingual interfaces; the concept of intentional cross-language discussion is the kernel of our idea. Meedan's mission is to break down the language barrier online with the latest in Machine Assisted Translation and compelling, human-scale interaction design.

Meedan's role is to lead a programming team into a community of teachers (rather than dragging the teachers toward the software!), and to ensure that the new platform is appropriate in every interaction. Meedan is responsible for making sure that the teacher experience is a good one for the teachers and that we do not just create something that is valuable on a technical level -- we ultimately have very practical goals. We want the teacher to succeed in the classroom. Our aim is education, software is merely a tool -- so we do not take the role of technology for granted and we in fact have seen many cases where technology in the classroom can be detrimental and wasteful. Just like many teachers, we are wary of "technology for technology's sake" -- but we know that there is great possibility, particularly in international communications technology. We have a fundamental interested in exposing students to broader culture, in addition to simply engaging students more in their work.

Our mandate is to guarantee a compelling and viable cross-language tool for translation, discussion and education. Thus, Meedan is supplying the programming necessary to actually create a new web platform. Our present focus is on language learning, and secondarily science education. 

#### How will we do this?  

The timeline of the project roughly looks as follows: 

- Our first step was to setup the infrastructure to support the project, including servers and new support staff. 
- Presently we have begun discussions with teachers and establish a baseline for the personality types in the focus group. Assess the limitations and possibilities of the assembled group; find new teachers if the first round is not appropriate. Deliver this 
- Next we take feedback from the teachers to release customized versions of the software which get closer to the "perfect" software that they would like to use. If the teachers do not like the software outright, we will abandon it and document the teacher's negative reaction. Find new teachers and expand the sample toward the most relevant demographic. This is the first iteration of our feeback cycle.
- Then we repeat the process of customizing software and getting feedback. 
- In 10 months we will produce a fully functioning, thoroughly tested platform which encapsulates the best designs from the research. 

So, we are in Month 2. We have begun the process of speaking with teachers. Our approach has been to maintain a very friendly and informal relationship so that we may elicit "brutally honest" feedback. Over the next 10 months we will be asking the teachers to experiment with various types of software, to conclude next year. 

#### Our investigation of the teachers will take several forms: 

- development of mental models of the teachers: how do they think? How do they work? (Young)
- development of numerous wireframes: to get feedback about what teachers immediately like
- Interviews with teachers, both over email, in person, and on the phone. Most of the interviews will be based on 
- place analysis, to gain an understanding of the actual environment that teachers work in (including classroom, school, and cultural environments.)

By the close of our investigations, we will have created a new platform for education -- and we will have a suitcase full of teacher feedback about it. Perhaps this is still a little bit vague, however, so let me give you some examples of the features that we are exploring with teachers: 

#### What are examples of what we might help teachers do?

- Maintain profile of their work and professional interests
- Manage video resources for the classroom
- Find and manage educational resources
- Update classroom status with a blog and other content publishing tools
- Tutor and study with customizable flash cards

And so on. You can imagine lots of possibilities even with just one technology, like video. There are easily thousands of possible directions we could go -- and this is why we must ground our inquiry in the direct feedback of teachers. We are depending on them to keep us from developing a unengaging product. My personal goal is to create something that is so in touch with the teachers that they find it irresistable, and do not want to teach without it. :) But as you know, not all teachers are the same. One tool may not be appropriate for every teacher in our study -- and understanding the different types of teachers is thus one important goal. We know the teachers are diverse, but we do not fully understand the way that the teachers are different from each other. And this is how we need your help. 

#### The basic (early stage) script for interviewing the teachers: 

Overall, at this stage, we are trying to gain a qualitative assessment of the teachers context so that we can get our bearings about how the teachers can help advance the project. 

1. Introduce the project and establish friendly, trusting rapport, the foundation for our relationship this year. We want to avoid making the teachers feel that they are on the spot to give "good" feedback. It may be difficult to get them to five candid feedback, but this is critical for us, so we need to take care to make sure that they feel we are trusted peers. We need them to give us the brutally honest opinions about things that we will be showing them over the coming months. 

2. Who are you and what do you teach? (Grade, courses taught, location, teacher background.) We need to make sure that the teacher fits within our existing models of teacher behavior -- and if they do not we can create a new category. 

3. What challenges do you face in the classroom? What are your big-picture problems? This is our opportunity to focus on the things that the teachers really need to achieve their educational goals. We want to gravitate toward their pain points -- hopefully we can help make these issues a little easier, but in many cases there will be issues that are beyond our control (such as lack of resources in the classroom). Even if we can't immediately address an issue, we need to be aware of obstacles to avoid a failed deployment.

4. What is your experience with technology in the classroom? What is your experience personally? (Do you use Facebook, etc.) This is intended to judge both the teacher's attitude about technology 

5. Do you have any questions (reassure the teacher that they can not give a "wrong" answer).


#### Teacher expectations

One of our biggest goals is to properly set teacher expectations about the nature of our work.

Teachers should expect to speak with one of us at least once a month for the next 10 months. They should expect to use various types of technology and to respond in writing, when prompted. They will be shown images from various types of educational software, which will will be testing internally, and customizing based on their comments. (We will be taking pictures of different software, flashcards, concepts, and sharing them via a central "hub" for research -- I will be sending more information about this when it is ready). The teachers will be treated as our eyes and ears to help identify some of the best tools -- and then they will guide us through the development and launch of our own platform (which will likely bring together several tools under one roof).

#### Big picture

If you imagine for a moment, there are hundreds of types of software available today. Our task is to A) eliminate the inferior tools and B) distill the best into our own platform. So you can see that, over the next month, we are going through a filter which will leave us with a very specific recommendation that is closely aligned with the teacher's perspectives, not our own pre-conceptions.

#### Our Philosophy

We have an incremental and conservative approach to requirements gathering and application development. We hope to close the gap between the developers, designers, managers, and all stakeholders, to create something that has undeniable and concrete value to teachers in the classroom. We are all too aware of many previous failed experiments in the classroom. Our opportunity, as designers, is to simply listen to the wise teachers who have seen many false starts and unrealized opportunities. We have seen some remarkable technologies emerge in the last few years. But in the classroom, the benefits of these technologies have been sporadic and uneven -- what are the underlying dynamics at work? What are the contraints and needs of the teachers? How can we build software that can maximize the connective capacity of the new communications technologies?
