# About This Site

This micro-site is intended to capture your interest and inspire new connections. It is a home for every morsel of design investigation.

We hope to display user experience findings in an engaging way throughout the lifecycle of the project using nonconventional layout and illustration techniques (eg, comics), conversational tone, participatory actions (eg comments and annotations). We believe that a simple browseable format is the most valuable way to cultivate an awareness of a difficult problem. 

As *hosts of a conversation*, we have a few simple principles:

* We understand that educational technology is a thorny, complex issue. 
* We value a diversity of input; There are no wrong answers. 
* We value openness and forthright discussion about subjects. 

Our approach is to continuously gather material which informs the strategy of our project.
